== Description ==

This plugin ONLY works with the Genesis theme. Do not install if you are not using Genesis.

This plugin lets you easily remove the page title from specific pages. Don't want "Home" at the top of your homepage? Activate, then edit the homepage and check "Hide".

You can also set sitewide defaults. If you don't want page titles on any pages, go to Genesis > Theme Settings > Title Toggle and check the appropriate box. Once a post type has the default set to remove, when editing a page you can selectively turn on that page's title.

Finally, if you're comfortable with code you can use the `be_title_toggle_post_types` filter to change the post types this applies to (it only applies to pages by default).
